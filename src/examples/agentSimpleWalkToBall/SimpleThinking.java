/**
 * Thinking-Class for Agent_SimpleWalkToBall.
 * This class takes action decisions for a simple scenario: If the ball lies in
 * front of the robot (shifted less than 30Â° to the left or right side), then 
 * the robot should walk towards it. Else the robot should turn left.
 * 
 * This class uses informations about the ball provided by an object of class
 * LocalFieldView, and robot movements provided by class KeyframeMotion. 
 * Therefore SimpleThinking depends on the functionality of these classes.
 * 
 * Usage by the agent class:
 * Call method decide() in each server cycle. 
 * Before the call the LocalFieldView object has to be updated, and after the call
 * the KeyframeMotion object must execute the chosen movement. 
 * 
 * Class Agent_SimpleWalkToBall gives an example of correct integration and 
 * usage.
