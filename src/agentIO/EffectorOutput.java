/** 
 * Send effector commands for the joints and the say effector in agent messages 
 * to the simulation server.
 * 
 * This class should realize the SimSpark syntax of the joint and say effector
 * commands, so programmers could concentrate on the content of the commands. 
 * 
 * Usage of this class and required context in the agent class: 
 * 1) Call the set...-methods to define the hinge joint and say effector 
 * commands that should be sent to the server. These methods normally will be 
 * used by all classes, which realize the robotÂ´s movements. Is a setter called
 * more than one time for a specific effector, then the last set value 
 * overrides the former ones. 
 * 2) Use the method sendAgentMessage() to send the commands defined with the
 * setters. This method should be executed once in each server cycle and
 * called inside the act()-method of the agent class. 
 * Only the commands that where set like in 1) are sent by the method 
 * sendAgentMessage(). If there has not been defined any command for an 
 * effector, then EffectorOutput also does not send any. 
 * 
 * See classes Agent_BasicStructure, Agent_SimpleWalkToBall and 
 * Agent_SimpleSoccer for usage examples. 
 * 
 * Neccessary synchronization, when the server runs in Agent Sync Mode:
 * Method sendAgentMessage() MUST be called exactly once in every server cycle, 
 * because it sends the "sync" command. 
 * 
 * It is possible to set the commands and send them more than one time during a 
 * server cycle, but the server will execute just one command for each effector.
 * Therefore the synchronization with the server (during the act()-method of the 
 * agent class) as decribed above is strongly recommended. 
 * 
 * Remember that a hinge joint executes a sent command until it gets a new one. 
 *

   * agent message, so the sent message content is "[passed agent message](syn)". 
   * When the server runs in the normal mode, the syn command is ignored, when 
   * it runs an gents sync mode, this command signalizes to the server, that the 
   * agent is ready for the next server cycle.
